        <h1>Rail Fence Cipher</h1>
        <p>
        The rail fence cipher is a bit more complicated than most others.  Rather than
        each letter simply being changed to a different letter, there's a lot more behind
        the scenes work with this one.  First the message typed in will be written based
        on a rail system.  The number of rails basically means the number of rows being used.
        The first letter of the message will be on the first line, then the second letter
        will be on the second line, third letter on the third line, so on.  If there are
        only three rails, it will stop at the third row and start going back up.  So
        in this case the fourth letter will be on the second row, fifth letter on the
        fifth row. </br>
        Here's an easy visual: </br>
        Typed in: my secret message </br>
        Rails: 3 </br>
        Outcome: </br>
        M----C------M----A----- </br>
        -Y--E--R--T--E--S--G-- </br>
        ---S------E------S------E </br>
        Then the final message will be made by reading left to right, starting with the first
        row. Spaces will be ignored.</br>
        So for this example, the final message will be "MCMAYERTESGSESE"
        </p>
